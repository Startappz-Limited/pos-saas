# SaaS Conversion Progress

Tracks each stage of [pos-saas-plan.md](pos-saas-plan.md), one row per committed step.
Stage files: [stages/](stages/README.md).

## Stage 0 (Phase 0): Development baseline

Branch: `saas/phase-0-baseline` (from `main` at `237bb7f`). Plan approved 13 October 2026.

### Starting result

Full suite on SQLite, 13 October 2026, before any stage work: **1,065 passed, 9 failed** (2,885
assertions). The same after `composer install` (step 1).

Known baseline failures (to be fixed in step 2):

| Test file | Test |
|---|---|
| `tests/Feature/SaleNotificationsTest.php` | SaleController WhatsApp notifications → sends SaleCompletedNotification (2 tests) |
| `tests/Feature/SaleNotificationsTest.php` | SaleController WhatsApp notifications → sends CreditBalanceNotification |
| `tests/Feature/SaleNotificationsTest.php` | SaleController WhatsApp notifications → sends PaymentReceivedNotification |
| `tests/Feature/Baileys/SaleNotificationSwitchesTest.php` | the switches actually gate delivery → sends only the text receipt |
| `tests/Feature/Baileys/SaleNotificationSwitchesTest.php` | the switches actually gate delivery → sends both when everything is on |
| `tests/Feature/CreditLedgerTest.php` | a credit sale debits the credit account → tells the customer |
| `tests/Feature/WhatsAppIntegrationTest.php` | Customer WhatsApp integration → can receive WhatsApp notifications |
| `tests/Feature/SecurityBaselineTest.php` | does not force https outside production by default |

### Steps

| Step | Commit | Tests added | Suite (SQLite) | Suite (MySQL 8) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Composer sync, PROGRESS.md | `f005222` | none | 1,065 passed, 9 failed (baseline) | not set up yet (step 4) | `composer install` downgraded 99 packages to the lock (Laravel 12.69.3 → 12.56.0, Pest 4.7.8 → 4.5.0); results unchanged |
| 2. Fix the 9 baseline failures | `100447a` | `TestEnvironmentTest` (3 tests) | **1,077 passed, 0 failed** | not set up yet (step 4) | Tests only; no production code changed. The 9 tests also pass in three random orders (seeds 1, 42, 1337) |
| 3. Live-data rule and safety hook | _this commit_ | `SafetyHookTest` (23 cases) | 1,077 passed, 23 skipped | not set up yet (step 4) | The hook now also blocks rolling back migrations, `TRUNCATE` without `TABLE`, `DELETE FROM` without `WHERE` and `DROP SCHEMA`, and allows commands that name only a `_testing` database. The 23 cases **skip locally** (lerd runs PHP in a container without `jq`); I verified them on the host shell instead (23/23). They run in CI, where `jq` is installed |

### Differences from the stage file

- The local database is MySQL 8.4.11 on `lerd-mysql` (`DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, database `fitness_center`),
  not MariaDB / remote `ecohub_pos`. `fitness_center` is treated as the read-only legacy database.
- Local mail already goes to Mailpit (`lerd-mailpit:1025`); only verification and documentation remain.
- **The 8 notification failures** (diagnosed in step 2): `Notification::fake()` doesn't record a
  notification whose `via()` returns no channels, and the WhatsApp notifications return none when
  WhatsApp isn't configured. These 8 tests go through the sale or notification path **without**
  configuring WhatsApp, so they only passed where `.env` held WhatsApp credentials. The stage file's
  explanation was right; my planning note saying otherwise was wrong. Fix: the tests call the new
  `configureWhatsApp()` helper (`tests/Pest.php`), and `phpunit.xml` forces the WhatsApp values blank.
- **The HTTPS failure:** `APP_URL` came from `.env` (`https://…`). `phpunit.xml` now forces
  `APP_URL=http://localhost`.
- The README links `pos-saas-project.md`; the plan file is `pos-saas-plan.md`.

### Follow-ups

- **`SmsChannel::isConfigured()` reads `env()` directly** (`app/Notifications/Channels/SmsChannel.php:66`),
  so tests can only switch SMS on with `putenv()`, and `phpunit.xml` can't pin it without breaking
  `NewEcommerceOrderNotificationTest`. Fixed with the SMS service in stage 6 (plan Phase 6, "SMS fix").
- **The hook matches text anywhere in a command**, including commit messages and heredocs, so a message
  that quotes a blocked command is refused. Workaround: pass long text through a file (`git commit -F`).
  Not worth weakening the hook for.
