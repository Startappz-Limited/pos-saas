# SaaS Conversion Progress

Tracks each stage of [pos-saas-plan.md](pos-saas-plan.md), one row per committed step.
Stage files: [stages/](stages/README.md).

## Stage 0 (Phase 0): Development baseline

Branch: `saas/phase-0-baseline` (from `main` at `237bb7f`). Plan approved 13 October 2026.

### Starting result

Full suite on SQLite, 13 October 2026, before any stage work: **1,065 passed, 9 failed** (2,885
assertions). The same after `composer install` (step 1).

Known baseline failures (to be fixed in step 2):

| Test file | Test |
|---|---|
| `tests/Feature/SaleNotificationsTest.php` | SaleController WhatsApp notifications → sends SaleCompletedNotification (2 tests) |
| `tests/Feature/SaleNotificationsTest.php` | SaleController WhatsApp notifications → sends CreditBalanceNotification |
| `tests/Feature/SaleNotificationsTest.php` | SaleController WhatsApp notifications → sends PaymentReceivedNotification |
| `tests/Feature/Baileys/SaleNotificationSwitchesTest.php` | the switches actually gate delivery → sends only the text receipt |
| `tests/Feature/Baileys/SaleNotificationSwitchesTest.php` | the switches actually gate delivery → sends both when everything is on |
| `tests/Feature/CreditLedgerTest.php` | a credit sale debits the credit account → tells the customer |
| `tests/Feature/WhatsAppIntegrationTest.php` | Customer WhatsApp integration → can receive WhatsApp notifications |
| `tests/Feature/SecurityBaselineTest.php` | does not force https outside production by default |

### Steps

| Step | Commit | Tests added | Suite (SQLite) | Suite (MySQL 8) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Composer sync, PROGRESS.md | _this commit_ | none | 1,065 passed, 9 failed (baseline) | not set up yet (step 4) | `composer install` downgraded 99 packages to the lock (Laravel 12.69.3 → 12.56.0, Pest 4.7.8 → 4.5.0); results unchanged |

### Differences from the stage file

- The local database is MySQL 8.4.11 on `lerd-mysql` (`DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, database `fitness_center`),
  not MariaDB / remote `ecohub_pos`. `fitness_center` is treated as the read-only legacy database.
- Local mail already goes to Mailpit (`lerd-mailpit:1025`); only verification and documentation remain.
- The 8 notification failures are not caused by `.env` WhatsApp settings (the tests set the config that
  `WhatsAppService::isConfigured()` reads); the real cause is diagnosed in step 2.
- The README links `pos-saas-project.md`; the plan file is `pos-saas-plan.md`.

### Follow-ups

None yet.
